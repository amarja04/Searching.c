# Searching.c


Binary Search is defined as a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(log N). 

To apply binary search in any data structure, the data structure must maintain the following properties:

The data structure must be sorted.
Access to any element of the data structure takes constant time.

Binary Search Algorithm can be implemented in two ways which are discussed below.

Iterative Method
Recursive Method
The recursive method follows the divide and conquer approach.
